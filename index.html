            <p>Growing up playing nearly every instrument they could get their hands on, it was only a matter of time before 7 got into production. Combining samples with live instrumentation gives their music a nostalgic, soulful feeling with their own twist to it. Inspired by producers like Madlib, J Dilla, and The Alchemist, 7 can make a beat feel like a song. Wind whistles, their debut project, is a 8 song beat tape that showcases some of their more recent work. They have also combined forces with Aniya Teno, cerating the duo of 7TEN. The duo is set to release an EP in May 2023. </p>
